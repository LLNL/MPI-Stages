\textbf{Re-initialize the state of an MPI library from a previously taken checkpoint.}\\

	In this approach, when there will be a process failure MPI will re-initialize itself and 
	will also be responsible for restarting the failed process.\\
	
	\textbf{Fault Detector}\\
	
	Need to incorporate a perfect fault detector within MPI runtime. If there is a process failure it should be able to detect and 
	propagate the failure information among all the surviving processes of the runtime. 
	It will be responsible to determine which processes need to be restarted.\\
	
	\textbf{Checkpoint of MPI:}\\
	
	A checkpoint/rollback module/ resilience MPI library - If checkpoint/restart support is needed, this module will be selected to run.\\
		
	Need to define checkpoints of MPI in a way that does not contain implementation-dependent aspects. 
	This way it will be possible to save a checkpoint from one library and loaded later from another library.\\
	
	Checkpoint will be taken synchronously, e.g., when the application saves its own state every N iterations in the main loop.
	While checkpointing, need to save minimal information.\\
	
	For MPI re-initialization, the communication layer needs the ability to handle any in-flight or interrupted messages. 
	It needs functionalities to cancel these messages and also to free the resources associated with it. 
	Also when MPI process will restart execution from a saved state, it should have the ability to re-establish connections.\\
	
	Need synchronization among the communicators in runtime.\\
