Place all implementation code into the source files instead of the header files.

Indentation 4-space per level

C code style: Allman

while (x == y)
{
    something();
    somethingelse();
}

finalthing();

brackets must be aligned, indentation is required. Brackets belong to parent level

if (condition)
{
	block
}
else
{
	block
}

Variable naming convention, no camelcase

make variable names meainingful!!!

no: 
a = 3
data = ...

yes:
receivers = 3
recv\_data = ...

Use underscores liberally.

No global variables, use singleton pattern for C++ objects. + Factory...

debug statements as much as required.

debug("this string" << variable << "another string")

will automagically intend and such.
